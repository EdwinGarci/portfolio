                My name is Edwin Fidel García Távara. I started programming in my career, with an inventory project. Currently I work focused on the backend.
                Some of my achievements include collaborating on a project for a company in Spain, and creating a crop management system for a company in my country.
                My goal is to improve as a developer to become a Software Architect.
